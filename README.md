## **Meet Mohammad: The Fearless Explorer and Master of Laughter!**


I'm a data scientist with a background in statistical analysis and machine learning. I've had the opportunity to work in diverse industries, including transportation, traffic safety, urban planning, insurance, and telematics data. Ever met someone who not only embraces challenges but greets them with a witty one-liner and a smile? That's Mohammad for you! 

I must admit, it's not common for someone to praise themselves, but here goes. We all know that in this world, we tend to be self-interested individuals who enjoy helping each other. With that in mind, I'd like to share my journey from a land far far away to my new home in Canada.

My latest challenge is mastering the French language. I'm currently in my second year of learning, and while I study diligently, it takes a lot of effort to make progress. J'étudie plus, mais il me faut beaucoup d'efforts pour atteindre mes objectifs.


## **Experience:**

### **Data Scientist  | Intact | Montreal, QC | 2022 – Present**
- Conduct in-depth research and analysis of sensor data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies related to accelerometer reorientation, traffic events, and crash detection using CNN models.
- Collaborate with a team of data science experts to develop innovative algorithms and models for time series data.
- Developed a successful method to reorient raw accelerometer data with 20% better accuracy.
- Created a novel machine learning algorithm to detect crash data from telematics time series data.
- Creating a robust data processing pipeline clean and analyse 10+ thousands response text data using LSTM, NB, LDA and CNN BiLSTM model (NLP).


### **Research Assistant (Data Analyst) | University of Tehran | 2020 – 2021**
- Developed a statistical model to analyze vehicle travel time during rush hour using Bluetooth sensors and WIFI data.
- Analyzed geo-spatial data with MATLAB and R, performing data cleaning, data manupulation, outlier identification, and interpolation.
- Constructed traffic congestion forecasting models utilizing ARIMA and Random Effect Time Series techniques, resulting in a notable 35% reduction in the loss function.
- Published two articles and presented research in Sweden Stockholm. [Reference: Ghavidel, Mohammad, et al. "A Random Effects Model for Travel-Time Variability Analysis Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Data." Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems 148.2 (2022): 05021012.]
