## **Meet Mohammad: The Fearless Explorer and Master of Laughter!**


I am a data scientist with a strong background in statistical analysis and machine learning.  My experience spans diverse industries, including transportation, traffic safety, urban planning, insurance, and telematics data. Ever met someone who not only embraces challenges but greets them with a witty one-liner and a smile? That's Mohammad for you! This extraordinary individual thrives on the thrill of learning, the excitement of pushing boundaries, and the sheer joy of humor. I konw I am the only person who have so many high prasial for myself. As every Body knows there is no good deed in the world we are selfish individuals who like to help each other. I present my journey from far far away to here in Canada. 
My newest challenge is master of français, I am on 2nd year of trail mode. J'étudie plus, mais il me faut beaucoup d'efforts pour atteindre.



## **Experience:**

### **Data Scientist  | Intact | Montreal, QC | 2022 – Present**
- Conduct in-depth research and analysis of sensor data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies related to accelerometer reorientation, traffic events, and crash detection using CNN models.
